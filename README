Do you love the Hot Towel SPA template by John Papa ?
Do you like TypeScript ?
Would you like to implement your viewmodel classes of Hot Towel in TypeScript ?
This project demonstrates how to do just that.  It includes a blank Hot Towel  project that has been converted to use TypeScript for the view models.
Unfortunately there are still small problems by integrating properly current version of TypeScript (0.8.3) with Durandal.  According to some blogs this issue is to be resolved in later versions of TypeScript.
Until then this is how it can be done without messing with the Durandal router system.
