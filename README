Do you love the Hot Towel SPA template by John Papa ? 
Do you like TypeScript ? 
Would you like to implement your viewmodel classes of Hot Towel in TypeScript ? 
This project demonstrates how to do just that. It includes a blank Hot Towel project that has been converted to use TypeScript for the view models. 

Requirements: 
1) Visual studio 2012 or 2013

2) VS2012 Web Essentials plugin.  NOTE !! Latest version of Web Essentials, 2.9 has problems with Typescript AMD at the moment.
Use older version i.e. 2.7: http://vswebessentials.com/nightly/webessentials2012-2.7.vsixor or the "Nightly builds"
See: http://vswebessentials.com/download and follow instructions there to set-up the Nightly builds update into Visual studio.

3) Compile Typescript with AMD option to true.
TypeScript must be configured to compile as AMD JavaScript.  To make sure, open Tools-Options in Visual Studio, then open Web Essentials section and set the "Use the AMD module" option to True.

Finally;
Please do not update the Durandal or Bootstrap packages in this project (using NuGet Package Manager).
The same applies for the current version of the HotTowel project template.
