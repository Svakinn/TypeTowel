Do you love the Hot Towel SPA template by John Papa ?
Do you like TypeScript ?

Would you like to implement your viewmodel classes of Hot Towel in TypeScript ?

This project demonstrates how to do just that.  It includes a blank Hot Towel project that has been converted to use TypeScript for the view models.
Unfortunately there are still small problems by integrating properly current version of TypeScript (0.8.3) with Durandal.  
According to some blogs this issue is to be resolved in later versions of TypeScript.

Until then this is how it can be done without messing with the Durandal router system.


Requirements:
VS2012
Web Essentials plugin
TypeScript
Compile Typescript with AMD option to true

Pleae note:
For the TypeScripts to work we must configure TypeScript to use the AMD module
In VS2012 open Tools-Options, open Web Essentials section and set the "Use the AMD module" option to True.
