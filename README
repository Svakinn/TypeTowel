This project demonstrates how typescript modules and classes can be used to implement TypeScript code in the famous 
Hot Towel project template by John Papa.

Unfortunenly there are still small problems by intergrating TypeScript classes with Durandal.
This example shows how this can be acheived for curent version of TypeScript (0.8.3)
According to some blogs this issu is to be resolved in later versions of TypeScript.

Until then this is how it can be done without messing with the Durandal router system.
